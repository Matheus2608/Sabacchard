# Sabacchard
==============

 Sabacchard works in this way: given a sequence of cards with values ​​in a specific order, alternately the playerer  
 first chooses a card from the ends to score and then chooses another card (also from the ends) to discard. The player 
 continues with this process of scoring and then discarding, until there are no more cards. The player's final score is
 the total points accumulated at the end of the process and if this value is not the maximum possible, the player loses.
