Sabacchard
In the Imperial Age, one of the most obscure games played on Numidian Prime is Sabacchard, a variation on the common card game Sabacc, the one in which Lando lost a Millennium 
Falcon. The Sabacchard works like this: given a sequence of cards with values in a specific order, alternately the player first chooses a card from the ends to score and then 
chooses another card (also from the ends) to discard. The player continues with this process of scoring and then discarding, until there are no more cards. The player's final 
score is the total points accumulated at the end of the process and if this value is not the maximum possible, the player loses.

So, Lando asked for your help to help him try to recover the damage for the lost ship, counting a program to calculate what maximum score the player should reach, given a deal of cards for the game.

Obs: Not always a strategy where you always choose the highest card to score leads to the lowest result (as per example 2). Thus, it is necessary to think of a solution strategy where 
all the various varieties of card choices are tested (suggestion: recursion). Lastly, once the correct solution is reached, there is a possibility that the runtime will not be 
enough to pass in all cases. Thus, an optimization using dynamics will be necessary.

Input
The entry contains 2 lines. The first line contains an even integer n where 1 <n <101. The second line contains n integers, separated by spaces, that represent the value of each letter.

Output
The output must contain an integer, whose value represents the maximum possible value to be achieved in the round.
